## Credit:
Idea, inspiration, and most audio comes from the Rainworld Push To Meow mod (duh) on Steam! You can find the mod [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3257541402) and the github repo [here](https://github.com/Andrew-Eathan/push-to-meow).

Alt sounds "INV" and "Andrew" are taken from the AltInvMeow mod found [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3264370847&searchtext=meow)!

This is my first mod, while I have done a lot of testing, apologies if anything is unoptimized or buggy! I'll do my best to address reports on the GitHub asap.
